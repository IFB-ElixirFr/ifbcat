# Imports
# AbstractBaseUser and PermissionsMixin are the base classes used when customising the Django user model
# BaseUserManager is the default user manager that comes with Django
# see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/auth/customizing/#auth-custom-user
# "settings" is for retrieving settings from settings.py file (project file)
#
# "gettext_lazy" is used to mark text (specically terms from controlled vocabularies) to support internatonalization.
# "gettext_lazy as _" defines '_()' as an alias for '_gettext_lazy()' - it's just a shorthand convention.
# see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/i18n/translation/#internationalization-in-python-code
# This "lazy" version of gettext() holds a reference to the translation string instead of the actual translated text,
# so the translation occurs when the value is accessed rather than when theyâ€™re called.  We need this behaviour so
# users will see the right language in their UI - see https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tips/2016/10/17/django-tip-18-translations.html

#
# User profiles are set by default to be active (is_active = ...) and are not staff (is_staff = ...)
# NB. staff users have access to Django admin etc.
# NB. The model is registered with Django admin in admin.py.  Django will use the class name (UserProfile)
# to create a name ("User Profiles") for the model used in the admin interface, e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
# Thus it's best practice to name the class "UserProfile" and not "UserProfiles"
# NB. For a list of attributes of the fields see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/fields/
#
# "blank=true" allows empty fields in data entry forms
# "null=true" means emptry values will be stored as NULL in the database
# NB. Both "blank=True" and "unique=True" are set for orcidid to avoid unique constraint violations when saving multiple objects with blank values.
# null is used because two null values ARE considered unique when compared (in contrast to two blank values, which are considered non-unique)
# Normally only "blank=True" is set for string-based fields (CharField, TextField)... see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/fields/#null
