# Imports
# AbstractBaseUser and PermissionsMixin are the base classes used when customising the Django user model
# see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/auth/customizing/#auth-custom-user
# "settings" is for retrieving settings from settings.py file (project file)
#
# "gettext_lazy" is used to mark text (specically terms from controlled vocabularies) to support internatonalization.
# "gettext_lazy as _" defines '_()' as an alias for '_gettext_lazy()' - it's just a shorthand convention.
# see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/i18n/translation/#internationalization-in-python-code
# This "lazy" version of gettext() holds a reference to the translation string instead of the actual translated text,
# so the translation occurs when the value is accessed rather than when theyâ€™re called.  We need this behaviour so
# users will see the right language in their UI - see https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tips/2016/10/17/django-tip-18-translations.html
