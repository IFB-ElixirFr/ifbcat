1. Make non-functional (but retain) APIView and ViewSet code added for testing purposes only:
  TestApiView and TestViewSet in views.py
  TestApiViewSerializer from serializers.py (used for both APIView & ViewSet code)
  urls.py (endpoints)
2. Add expertise field to UserProfile model (models.py, serializers.py, and search_fields in views.py)
3. Consolidate UpdateOwnNewsItems and UpdateOwnEvent into single function (if this turns out to really be generic)
4. Prevent UI allowing negative values to be picked for maxParticipantsin Event (in "HTML form")
- even though validation is OK and complains if a negative value is specified.
- NB django admin interface does NOT let negative values be picked
5. Look into what "is_staff" implies, and update the "help_text" (or remove this feature, if not needed)
6. Support generation of OpenAPI docs, see https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/schemas/
7. See if textarea fields in browsable API (Event->Description, Event->Venue) should be non-resizable - or remove such styling if we don't go down this route for the front end
8. See if 'id' on Event, EventKeyword etc. need to be (de)serialised  - if not update serializers.py
9. Set "None" default values to orcidid and homepage in create_user (see https://github.com/joncison/ifbcat-sandbox/pull/2) as needed.
10. Refactor "cost" field in Event model to allow multiple selections (one only currently)
11. Refactor to remvove duplication of controlled vocabularies (e.g. Event->Cost, Event->Accessibility etc.) in serializers.py and models.py
12. Set up filtering for Event in browsable API
