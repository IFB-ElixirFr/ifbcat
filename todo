1. Clean up or remove /changelog endpoint (APIView code added primarily for testing purposes only):
  ChangelogView in views.py
  ChangelogSerializer from serializers.py
  urls.py (endpoints)
2. Make non-functional (but retain) API ViewSet code added for testing purposes only:
  TestViewSet in views.py
  urls.py (endpoints)
3. Add expertise field to UserProfile model (models.py, serializers.py, and search_fields in views.py)
4. Consolidate UpdateOwnNewsItems and UpdateOwnEvent into single function (if this turns out to really be generic)
5. Prevent UI allowing negative values to be picked for maxParticipantsin Event (in "HTML form")
- even though validation is OK and complains if a negative value is specified.
- NB django admin interface does NOT let negative values be picked
6. Look into what "is_staff" implies, and update the "help_text" (or remove this feature, if not needed)
7. Support generation of OpenAPI docs, see https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/schemas/
8. Fix resizable data entry fields in browsable API (Event->Description, Event->Venue) - or remove such styling if we don't go down this route for the front end
9. Check 'id': {'read_only': True},  (set in EventSerializer and NewsItemSerializer) works as expected (i.e. id is not writeable) ... and look to replace the multiple "read only" definitions using a single "read_only_fields" line in extra_kwargs
10. See if we really need to be (de)serialising 'id' on EventKeyword (I seriously doubt it!) - if so update serializers.py
